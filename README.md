## Face Detection

A python script using the OpenCV library to detect faces in an image or a video using the webcam. The scripts will draw a green rectangle for every face found. If you want to test it with an image, you will have to add a tester image to the repo and specify its path in the `image_path` inside the `detection-script.py`. If not, then there are necessary instructions inside the script on how to run it with only your webcam. 

## Running the script

Run the following command to run the script:
```bash
python3 detection-script.py
```
